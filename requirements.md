# Requirements Document: Personal Blog Frontend Application

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a frontend application for a software engineer's personal blog. The application will provide a clean, modern interface for displaying blog entries with filtering capabilities, responsive design, and theme options.

## 2. Technical Stack

- **Framework/Library**: React with Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (latest version) - Use https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite to get latest instructions
- **Backend Communication**: REST API

## 3. Design Requirements

### 3.1 General Design

- Implement a minimalist yet visually appealing design
- Support both light and dark themes with seamless switching
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Use consistent typography and color schemes across the application
- Consider `catppuccin` for the dark theme

### 3.2 Theme Switching

- Provide a toggle for users to switch between light and dark themes
- Persist theme preference in local storage
- Apply theme changes immediately without page reload

## 4. Layout Requirements

### 4.1 Header

- Display website logo/branding
- Include theme toggle switch
- Maintain fixed position during scrolling

### 4.2 Main Content Area

The main content should be divided into two columns:

#### 4.2.1 Left Column (Profile Section)
- Display author profile with round avatar image
- Include short bio/description
- List social media links (GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Ensure this column is smaller than the blog content column

#### 4.2.2 Right Column (Blog Entries)
- Display blog posts in a vertical flex layout
- Each blog entry should contain:
  - Title
  - Publication date
  - Short description/excerpt
  - Estimated reading time
  - Associated tags
  - Visual indication that it's clickable
- Include filtering options for:
  - Date ranges
  - Tags/categories

### 4.3 Footer

- Display contact information
- Include copyright notice
- Show additional information (e.g., technologies used)

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Blog Post Retrieval

- Fetch blog posts from backend API using REST
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Show loading animation during data retrieval
- Support pagination if number of posts exceeds display limit

### 5.2 Filtering and Sorting

- Enable filtering by tags/categories
- Allow date-based filtering
- Update post list dynamically as filters change without page reload
- Provide visual feedback when filters are applied

### 5.3 Blog Post Display

- Display blog post list in a card format on main page
- Implement smooth transition/animation when opening a post
- Support Markdown rendering for blog content
- Provide a "back to list" option when viewing a single post

## 6. User Experience Requirements

### 6.1 Loading States

- Display loading animations during data fetching
- Implement skeleton loaders for content that is being loaded
- Ensure smooth transitions between states

### 6.2 Animations

- Add subtle animations for state changes and interactions
- Implement smooth transitions when opening blog posts
- Use appropriate hover effects on interactive elements

### 6.3 Accessibility

- Ensure proper contrast ratios for text readability
- Provide appropriate aria attributes for screen readers
- Support keyboard navigation

## 7. Component Architecture

Organize the codebase into modular components:

- Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
- Blog components (PostCard, PostList, PostView)
- UI components (Button, Card, ThemeToggle)
- Hook-based logic (useTheme, usePosts)

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Implement code splitting for optimized loading
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize re-renders using appropriate React patterns
- Cache fetched blog posts to reduce API calls

## 9. Testing Requirements

- Implement unit tests for core components
- Test theme switching functionality
- Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
- Validate accessibility compliance

## 10. Deployment Considerations

- Support for environment-specific configurations
- Build optimization for production deployment
- Compatibility with common hosting platforms
